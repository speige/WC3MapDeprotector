## Disclaimer
This program is not perfect. Deprotection is complicated and every map is different. Manual bug fixes may be necessary.
To troubleshoot potential issues, press the help button embedded in the app or click on bug report.

## Watermarks
To help players avoid distributing or playing hacked maps, this tool intentionally adds both obvious & subtle clues to tell a player it has been deprotected. If your goal is to maintain a dead map, you will need to remove these by hand. I will not tell you how to do it, think of it as a coding test to prove you are worthy to take over maintenance of the map.

## Ethical Notice
Usage of this app requires acceptance of the following ethical notice:

${\color{red}Hacking /  Cheating}$
> Cheat Packs & Hacks ruin the map for the community. Distributing hacked versions on Battle.net is ${\color{red}toxic}$.\
> It will ruin the experience for other players which in turn ruins the reputation of the original authors.\
> If this causes map makers to become disgruntled, it hurts all gamers.\
> The ${\color{red}ONLY}$ valid caveat to ${\color{red}Hacking}$ is for experimentation on ${\color{red}SINGLE\text{-}PLAYER}$ or with friends.\
> For example, if the map is impossible to beat due to balancing issues or the level grinding is too slow and not fun.\
> It is fine to re-balance for ${\color{red}PERSONAL}$ use only. ${\color{red}DO\ NOT\ distribute\ these\ on\ Battle.net}$

Maintaining a Dead Map
> Please pick a new map name to avoid confusing the existing player base.\
> For example, rename from “DOTA” to “DOTA Resurrected” or “DOTA Reforged”, etc.\
> Please also give credit to the original map creator on your map splash screen.\
> Please do extensive testing and fix any bugs caused by deprotection before releasing on Battle.net

${\color{red}Copyright}$
> A map contains an author’s hard work and is protected by law as intellectual property.\
> Although maps are available for free, they are still protected by copyright law.\
> Deprotection is perfectly legal as long as it’s for learning and/or bug fixing.\
> However, claiming someone else’s work as your own is stealing and is illegal.
