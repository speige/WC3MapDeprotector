You accidentally clicked "Source Code" under GitHub Releases.
You probably meant to click "WC3MapDeprotector.zip" to download the actual program

You can download it here:
https://github.com/speige/WC3MapDeprotector/releases/latest/download/WC3MapDeprotector.zip


If you actually want to read the source code, Google how to "clone" the repository instead.
